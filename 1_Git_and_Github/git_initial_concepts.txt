==== WHAT IS GIT ====

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.

==== WHAT IS VERSION CONTROLL ==== 

Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory. This approach is very common, but is problematic for a lot of reasons.
In software engineering, version control is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs.

==== WHAT IS GIT AND HOW IT WORKS ====

The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Version Control System) is the way Git thinks about its data. 
Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes.
Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. 
With Git, every time you commit, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

==== THE THREE STATES ====

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed.

- Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
- Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local repository.

==== GIT BASIC WORKFLOW ====

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:

- You modify files in your working tree.
- You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.
- You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.

The most common and useful way to use Git is via command line interface.
