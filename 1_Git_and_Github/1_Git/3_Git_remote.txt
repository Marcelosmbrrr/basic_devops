==== GET REMOTE REPOSITORY ====

You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere with "git clone [repo url]".

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton.

==== COMMANDS ====

git clone [repo url]: clone a remote repository
git fetch: git fetch fetches differences from the current branch, but doesn't change anything on that branch 
git pull: pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet
git push origin: push all local data for remote repository
git remote add origin [repo url]: is used to refer to a remote repository, but do not pull anything - its just a pointer for future actions
