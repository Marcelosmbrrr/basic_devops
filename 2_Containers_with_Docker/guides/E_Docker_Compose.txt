Docker compose is a docker containers orchestrator. 
Imagine how much effort will cost if you need to run dozens of containers manually from the command line.
Docker compose is a solution for this. With one file, you can describe and run multiple containers - each container is called a "service".
In the Docker interface, a running compose appears like a named set of running containers.

==== DOCKER COMPOSE FILE ====

The Docker Compose definition file is written with the YAML language.
This file is used to define events and definitions before and after the execution of services (aka container).
For example, if the application will have MySQL, PHP and Laravel, each of these parts will be a service/container, and it is in the composer file that all the working parameters will be declared.
This file by default is named docker-compose.yml and must be created in the root directory of the project.
