==== NETWORK ====

Source: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/07_multi_container/

Remember that containers, by default, run in isolation and don’t know anything about other processes or containers on the same machine. 
So, how do we allow one container to talk to another? The answer is networking.
If two containers are on the same network, they can talk to each other. If they aren’t, they can’t.

Commands:
docker network ls
docker network create [optional_network_type] [network_name]

Commands with containers:
docker run --network [network] [image]
docker network connect [network] [container_in_execution]
docker network disconnect [network] [container]
docker network inspect [network]
docker rm [network]

==== DOCKER NETWORK ====

Docker supports different types of networks, each suitable for certain use cases.
Docker allows you to build three different types of network drivers out of the box: none, bridge, and host.

==== BRIDGE DRIVER - docker0 ====

This is the default driver. All initialized containers connect to the network bridge.
The bridge is a network interface called docker0 that exists between the containers and the host machine.
It allows containers to connect to the internet and establish communication with each other.

==== HOST DRIVER ====

This mode only works on Linux OS machines and what it does is remove the bridge, and make the containers connect directly to the host machine's network resources.

==== NONE DRIVER ====

This mode is "networkless" - the container does not communicate with others or with the outside world.

==== OVERLAY SWARM ====

Advanced Docker networking mode for clusters created with Swarm.
